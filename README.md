## Computational Biology & Statistical Genetics Portfolio  
This repository showcases my work in **computational biology, statistical genetics, and data analysis**. It contains Python and R scripts covering data cleaning, modeling, differential gene expression analysis, machine learning, and Mendelian Randomization.  
It serves both as a portfolio of my coding work and as a collection of reproducible workflows for computational biology projects.

## NOTE: 
R scripts:
Requires R ≥ 4.0 and packages like tidyverse, glmnet, MendelianRandomization. Install packages:
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "glmnet", "MendelianRandomization"))
```
Python scripts:
Requires Python ≥ 3.x and relevant libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib). Install dependencies
